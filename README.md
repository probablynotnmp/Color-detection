## Color Detection Model

Color detection is the technique of determining the name of any colour in a picture. 
For humans, this is a very simple task, but it is not that simple for computers. 
Color detection is required for object recognition, and it is also utilised in a variety of picture editing and drawing apps. 


### This project uses Machine Learning to extract a set number of colors from an image. This is an implementation of detecting multiple colors in real-time using Python programming language. We are going to perform both Color detection and color labeling on objects in images. We then present a pie chart describing colors found in a given image.
